I am currently a Visiting Research Scholar in [Visual Intelligence Lab](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/vil.html) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) working with [Prof. Devi Parikh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/) and [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/index.html).
I graduated with an MS in Computer Science and Statistics from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) where I was advised by [Prof. Xiao Wang](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wangxiao/).

Prior to that, I was an undergrad at [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in) where I recieved B.Tech + M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I was advised by [Prof. Partha Pratim Chakrabarti](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~ppchak/) for my B.Tech thesis and [Prof. Bivas Mitra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~bivasm/) for my M.Tech thesis.

I spent a wonderful summer in 2014 at [HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/home) working with [Prof. Pan Hui](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~panhui/) and in 2013 working at [Qualcomm Inc.](https://www.qualcomm.com/) 

Besides research, I enjoy nature, especially mountains. My adventures in the Himalayas are some of the most memorable ones.
